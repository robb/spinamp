MooAMP - skin for Winamp 2.0+
=============================
Version 2.6

What is MooAMP?
---------------
MooAMP is a skin for Nullsoft's Winamp 2.0 or later. It completely changes the original 
style to a well made and useful cow style.

Installation problems
---------------------
If you have an older version of Winamp you need to save the .wsz file on your drive and 
then unzip it to your [\Winamp\Skins] directory, usually located under [\Program Files].

Then enter [Options/Skin Browser] or use Alt+S and mark the folder/filename. Now everything 
is set.

Why?
----
Got the idea to make a cow patterned skin from my near friend [Jedi] (jedi@beckomberga.org).
He's a big cowlover and therefore I'm dedicating this skin to him and ofcourse all you 
cowlovers out there. Hope you like it, cause I had alot of fun making it. 

It took about 7 hard working hours to complete the main skin, about 7 to complete the 
playlist and ecowlizer, about 2 hours for the avs and about 9 more hours to make all updates.
